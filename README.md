# WordPress Super Editor
Allow editors to add and edit users and manage widgets and menus. Allow authors to take on the role of editors by letting them edit pages.

~~Cold bloodedly ripped from~~ Inspired by and mostly unchanged code from [Stack Overflow](http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/4479/editor-can-create-any-new-user-except-administrator).
